# DocumentSummarization
Summarize a pdf
This is a code to use OpenAI to create summarization of a PDF file.
The file is chunked into 1000 tokens and the summary of a chunk is created and the next chunk is added to the summary to generate the new summary.
This approach can be labeled as the Rolling summary of the MapReduce technique of creating summary.
